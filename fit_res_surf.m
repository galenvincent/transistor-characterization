% Fit data with some kind of response surface


function lms = fit_res_surf(datatab)
%datatab is the table returned from read_database
%model_fun is the equation for the model that you would like to use.
    % Ex. model_fun = 'RTMobFor~

% For all values that are NaN, or weren't able to be measured becasue of
% device failure, change the metrics to be 25% worse than the worst metric
% actually measured.

%Is this cool for vt?? maybe not because it could be positive or negative
